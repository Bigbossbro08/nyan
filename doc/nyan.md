## WTF?

**nyan** is a strongly typed hierarchical key-value database with patch
functionality and inheritance.


## Srsly?

Let's create a new unit with a mod: a japanese tentacle monster.

``` python
TentacleMonster(Unit):
    name = "Splortsch"
    hp = 2000

Creation<TownCenter>():
    creates += {TentacleMonster}

TentacleMod(Mod):
    name = "Add the allmighty tentacle monster to your holy army"
    patches = {Creation}
```

Things like `Unit` and `Mod` are provided by the game engine,
`TownCenter` is provided by the base game data.

When the engine activates the mod, your town center can create the new unit.



## Design idea

[openage](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage) requires a very complex data
storage to represent the hierarchy of its objects. Research and technology
affects numerous units, civilization bonuses, monk conversions and all that
with the goal to be ultimatively moddable by the community:

Current data representation formats make this nearly impossible to
accomplish. Readability problems or huge lexical overhead led us to
design a language crafted for our needs.

Enter **nyan**, which is our approach to store data in a new way™.


## Design goals

Requirements:

* nyan remains a general-purpose data language
* Data is stored in `.nyan` files
* Human readable
* Portable
* More or less compact (readability > memory)
* Data is stored as members of `nyan::Object`s
* Data is changed by patches that change members of `nyan::Object`s
* Patches can be changed by patches, that way, any mod can be created
* Data does not contain any executed code but can specify function names
  and parameters. The game engine is responsible for calling those
  functions or redirecting to custom scripts
* Namespaces to create a logical hierarchy of `nyan::Object`s
* Some `.nyan` files are shipped with the game engine
  * They describe things the engine is capable of, basically the mod api
  * That way, the engine can be sure that things exist
  * The engine can access all nyan file contents with type safety
  * The data files of the game then extend and change the API `nyan::Object`s
* The nyan database provides a C++ API used by the game engine
  * Can parse `.nyan` files and add all information to the database
  * Provides hooks so the engine can react on internal changes


## Language features

* nyan allows easy modding
  * Data packs ship configuration data and game content as .nyan files
  * Mod Packs can change and extend existing information easily,
    by applying data "patches"
  * Patches are applied whenever the libnyan user decides
    when or where to do so
* nyan is typesafe
  * The type of a member is stored when declaring it
  * No member type casts
  * Only allowed operators for a member type can be called
* nyan is invented here™
  * we can change the specification to our needs whenever we want

Concept:

* The only things nyan can do: Hierarchical data declaration and patches
  * *`nyan::Object`*: In a .nyan file, you write down `nyan::Object`s
  * A `nyan::Object` has an aribitrary number of members
  * A member has a data type like `int`
* `nyan::Object`s support a hierarchy by inheritance
  * You can fetch values from a `nyan::Object` and the result is determined
    by walking up the whole inheritance tree
  * This allows changing a value in a parent class and all childs are
    affected then
* `nyan::Object`s are placed in namespaces to organize the directory structure


### Data handling

* *`nyan::Object`*: versatile atomic base type
  * Has named members which have a type and maybe a value
  * `nyan::Object`s remain abstract until all members have values
  * There exists no order of members
* **nyan::Patch**: is a `nyan::Object` and denominates a patch
  * Patches are used to change a target `nyan::Object` at runtime
  * It is created for exactly one `nyan::Object` with `PatchName<TargetObject>`
  * Internally, the target object is referenced in a member named `__patch__`
  * Can modify **member values** of the assigned `nyan::Object`
  * Can add **inheritance** parents of the target `nyan::Object`
  * Can add new members, but not remove them
* A `nyan::Object` can inherit from an ordered set of `nyan::Object`s
  (-> from a *nyan::Patch* as well)
  * Members of parent objects are inherited
  * When inheriting, existing values can be modified by operators
    defined for the member type
  * Member values are calculated accross the inheritance upwards
    * That way, patching a parent object impacts all children
    * When a value from a `nyan::Object` is retrieved,
      walk up every time and sum up the value
  * If there is a member name clash, there can be two reasons for it
    * The member originates from a common base object (aka the [diamond problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem))
      * We use [C3 linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization) to determine the calculation order
      * Just access the member as always (`member += whatever`)
    * Two independent objects define the same member
      and you inherit from both
      * The child class must access the members by `ParentObj.member`
      * Further child objects must use the same explicit access
    * If both conflicts occur simultaneously (common parent defines member
      and another parent defines it independently)
      * C3 is applied first (unifies members by a common parent)
      * Name conflicts must then resolved by manual qualification again
* A mod API could be implemented as follows:
  Create a `nyan::Object` named `Mod` that has a member with a set
  of patches to apply
  * To create a mod: Inherit from this `Mod` `nyan::Object` and
    add patches to the set
  * List the object name in an ordinary .conf-style file so the engine
    knows the name and can query for it
  * The game engine then applies the patches of that object at the
    appropriate moment


### Syntax

``` python
# This is an example of the nyan language
# The syntax is very much Python.
# But was enhanced to support easy hierarchical data handling.

# A nyan::Object is created easily:
ObjName():
    member : TypeName = value

    member_name : Object
    ...

Inherited(ObjName, OtherObj, ...):
    member += 10
    ObjName.member_name = "stuff"

PatchName<TargetNyanObject>[+AdditionalParent, +OtherNewParent, ...]():
    member_to_modify = absolute_value
    member_to_update += relative_value
    new_member : TypeName = value

ParentObject():
    NestedObject(Inherited):
        another_member : type = value
        ...

    some_member : Inherited = NestedObject
    ...
```

* An object declares a named storage space with then has key-value pairs
* If an object does not have a parent, it implicitly inherits from the built-in `Object`
* Nested object names are prefixed the parent name, on top level their name is `ParentObject.NestedObject`
* A member is created by *declaring* it by `member_name : type`
* A member is *defined* by `member_name = value`
* An inherited member is referenced by either `member_name` or `ParentObject.member_name`
* The declaration and definition can be combined:
  `member_name : type = value`
* A member can never be defined if it was not declared
* A `nyan::Object` is "abstract" iff it contains at least one undefined member
* A `nyan::Object` member **type** can never be changed once declared
* The parents of a `nyan::Object` are stored in a member
  `__parents__ : orderedset(Object)`
  * Getting this member will provide the inheritance linearization

* It is a patch iff `<Target>` is written in the definition or the object
  has a member `__patch__ : Object`
  * The patch can only be applied for the specified object or any child of it
  * A patch can add a new inheritance parent to the target
    * Done with the `[+AdditionalParent, ...]` syntax, which just creates
      a member `__parents_add__ : orderedset(Object)`
    * This can be used to inject a "middle object" in between two inheriting
      objects, because the multi inheritance linearization resolves the order
      * Imagine something like `TentacleMonster -> Unit`
      * What we now want is `TentacleMonster -> MonsterBase -> Unit`
      * What we do first is create `MonsterBase -> Unit`
      * After applying a patch with `+MonsterBase` it is `TentacleMonster -> Unit, MonsterBase`
      * The linearization will result in `TentacleMonster -> MonsterBase -> Unit`
* The patch will fail to be loaded if:
  * The patch target is not known
  * Any of changed members is not present in the patch target
  * Any of the added parents is not known
  * -> Blind patching is not allowed
* The patch will succeed to load if:
  * The patch target already inherits from a parent to be added
  * -> Inheritance patching doesn't conflict with other patches


#### Multi inheritance

The parents of a `nyan::Object` are kind of a mixin for members:

* The child object obtains all the members from its parents
* When a member value is requested, the value is calculated by
  backtracking through all the parents until the first value definition.
* If name clashes occur, the loading will error, unless you fix them:
* Parent member names can be qualified to fix the ambiguity:

Both `Parent` and `Other` have a member named `member`:

``` python
NewObj(Parent, Other):
    Parent.member = 1337
    Other.member -= 42
```

Children of that object must access the members with the qualified names
as well to make the access clear.

Consider this case, where we have 2 conflicts.

``` python
Top():
    entry : int = 10

A(Top):
    entry += 5
    otherentry : int = 0
    specialentry : int = 42

B(Top):
    entry -= 3
    otherentry : int = 1

C():
    entry : int = 20
    otherentry : int = 2


LOLWhat(A, B, C):
    # We now have several conflicts in here!
    # How is it resolved?
    # A and B both get a member `entry` from Top
    # A and B both declare `otherentry` independently
    # C declares `entry` and `otherentry` independently
    # LOLWhat now inherits from all, so it has
    # * `entry` from Top or through A or B
    # * `entry` from C
    # * `otherentry` from A
    # * `otherentry` from B
    # * `otherentry` from C
    # ->
    # to access any of those, the name must be qualified:

    A.entry += 1     # or B.entry/Top.entry is the same!
    C.entry += 1
    A.otherentry += 1
    B.otherentry += 1
    C.otherentry += 1

    specialentry -= 42


OHNoes(LOLWhat):
    # access to qualified members remains the same
    A.entry += 1
    specialentry += 1337
```

The detection of the qualification requirement works as follows:

* The inheritance list of `LOLWhat` determined by `C3` is `[A, B, Top, C]`
* When in `LOLWhat` the `C.entry` value is requested, that list is walked
  through until a value declaration for each member was found:
  * `A` declares `otherentry` and `specialentry`, it changes `entry`
  * `B` declares `otherentry` and changes `entry`
    * Here, nyan detects that `otherentry` was declared twice
    * If it was defined without declaration, it errors because no parent
      declared `otherentry`
    * The use of `otherentry` is therefore enforced to be qualified
  * `Top` declares `entry`
  * `C` declares `entry` and `otherentry`
    * Here, nyan detects that `entry` and `otherentry` are declared again
    * The access to `entry` must hence be qualified, too
* nyan concludes that all accesses must be qualified,
  except to `specialentry`, as only one declaration was found
* The qualification is done by prefixing the precedes a `nyan::Object` name
  which is somewhere up the hierarchy and would grant conflict-free access
  to that member
* That does **not** mean the value somewhere up the tree is changed!
  The change is only defined in the current object, the qualification just
  ensures the correct target member is selected!


If one now has the `OHNoes` `nyan::Object` and desires to get values,
the calculation is done like this:

* Just like defining a change, the value must be queried using
  a distinct name, i. e. the qualification prefix.
* In the engine, you call something like `OHNoes.get("A.entry")`
  * The inheritance list by C3 of `OHNoes` is `[LOLWhat, A, B, Top, C]`
  * The list is gone through until the declaration of the requested member
    was found
  * `LOLWhat` did not declare it
  * `A` did not declare it either, but we requested `"A.entry"`
  * As the qualified prefix object does not declare it, the prefix is dropped
  * The member name is now unique and can be searched for without the prefix
    further up the tree
  * `B` does not declare the `entry` either
  * `Top` does declare it, now the recursion goes back the other way
  * `Top` defined the value of `entry` to `10`
  * `B` wants to subtract `3`, so `entry` is `7`
  * `A` adds `5`, so `entry` is `12`
  * `LOLWhat` adds `1`, `entry` is `13`
  * `OHNoes` adds `1` as well, and `entry` is returned to be `14`


#### Types

* Members of `nyan::Object` must have a type, which can be a
  * primitive type
    - `text`:     `"lol"`          - (duh.)
    - `int`:      `1337`           - (some number)
    - `float`:    `42.235`, `inf`  - (some floating point number)
    - `bool`:     `True`, `False`  - (some boolean value)
    - `file`:     `"./name" `      - (some filename, relative to the directory
                                      the defining nyan file is located at.
                                      If absolute, the path is relative to
                                      an engine defined root directory)
  * ordered set of elements of a type: `orderedset(type)`
  * set of elements of a type: `set(type)`
  * currently, there is **no** `list(type)` specified,
    but may be added later if needed
  * `nyan::Object`, to allow arbitrary hierarchies

* Type hierarchy
  * A `nyan::Object`'s type name equals its name: `A()` has type `A`
  * A `nyan::Object` `isinstance` of all the types of its parent `nyan::Object`s
    * Sounds complicated, but is totally easy:
    * If an object `B` inherits from an object `A`, it also has the type `A`
    * Just like the multi inheritance of other programming languages
    * Again, name clashes of members must be resolved
      to avoid the diamond problem

* All members support the assignment operator `=`
* Many other operators are defined on the primitive types
  * `text`: `=`, `+=`
  * `int` and `float`: `=`, `+=`, `*=`, `-=`, `/=`
  * `bool`: `=`, `&=`, `|=`
  * `file`:`= "./delicious_cake.png"`
  * `set(type)`:
    * assignment: `= {value, value, ...}`
    * union: ` += {..}`, `|= {..}` -> add objects to set
    * subtract: `-= {..}` -> remove those objects
    * intersection: `&= {..}` -> keep only objects element of both
  * `orderedset(type)`:
    * assignment: `= <value, value, ...>`
    * append: `+= <..>` -> add objects to the end if not existing
    * subtract: `-= <..>`, `-= {..}` -> remove those objects
    * intersection: `&= <..>`, `&= {..}` -> keep only objects element of both
  * `dict(keytype, valuetype)`:
    * assignment: `= {key: value, k: v, ...}`
    * insertion of data: `+= {k: v, ...}`, `|= {..}`
    * deletion of keys: `-= {k, k, ...}`, `-= {k: v, ..}`
    * keep only those keys: `&= {k, k, ..}`, `&= {k: v, ..}`
  * `nyan::Object` reference:
    * `=` set the reference to some other `nyan::Object`


### Namespaces, imports and forward declarations

Namespaces and imports work pretty much the same way as Python defined it.
They allow to organize data in an easy hierarchical way on your file system.


#### Implicit namespace

A nyan file name is implies its namespace. That means the file name must
not contain a `.` (except the `.nyan`) to prevent naming conflicts.

`thuglife/units/backstreet.nyan`

Data defined in this file is in namespace:

`thuglife.units.backstreet`

An object is then accessed like:

`thuglife.units.backstreet.DrugDealer`


#### Importing

A file is loaded when another file imports it.
This is done by loading another namespace.

``` python
import thuglife
```

You can define convenience aliases of fully qualified names
with the `import ... (as ...)` statement.

This imports the namespace with an alias (right side)
which expands to the left side when used.

``` python

Frank(thuglife.units.backstreet.DrugDealer):
    speciality = "Meth"


# is the same as:

import thuglife.units.backstreet.DrugDealer as DrugDealer

Frank(DrugDealer):
    speciality = "Meth"


# which is also the same as

import thuglife.units.backstreet as thugs

Frank(thugs.DrugDealer):
    speciality = "Meth"
```


#### Cyclic dependencies

Inheritance can never be cyclic (duh). Member value usage can be cyclic.

Usage as member value can be done even though the object is not yet
declared. This works as objects in member values are always "pointers".

The compatibility for the value type is tested just when the
referenced object was actually loaded.
This means there are implicit forward declarations.

Example: deer death

``` python
# engine features:

Ability():
    ...

Behaviour():
    ...

Resource():
    name : text

DieAbility(Ability):
    die_animation : file
    become : Unit

Huntable(Ability):
    hunting_reaction : Behaviour

Unit():
    abilities : set(Ability)
    hp : int

ResourceSpot():
    resource_type : Resource
    amount : float

IntelligentFlee(Behaviour):
    ...


# content pack:

Animal(Unit):
    ...

Deer(Animal):
    DeerDie(DieAbility):
        die_animation = "deer_die.png"
        become = DeadDeer

    DeerHuntable(Huntable):
        hunting_reaction = IntelligentFlee

    hp = 10
    graphic = "deer.png"
    abilities |= {DeerDie, DeerHuntable}

DeadDeer(Deer, ResourceSpot):
    DeerFood(ResourceAmount):
        type = Food
        amount = 250

    graphic = "dead_deer.png"
    resources = {DeerFood}
```


##### Forward declarations

The engine has to invoke the check whether all objects that were used as
forward declaration were actually defined.

If there are dangling forward declaration objects when invoking that
consistency check, a list of missing objects will be provided. These have
to be provided in order for nyan to load. Otherwise the objects affected
by incomplete members cannot be used.


##### Cyclic avoidance

If you encounter a cyclic dependency, try to redesign your data model by
extracting the common part as a separate object and then use it in both
old ones.


## nyan interpreter

`.nyan` files are read by the nyan interpreter part of `libnyan`.

* You feed in a directory containing many `.nyan` files
* It parses the contents and adds it to the `nyan::Database`
* It does type checking to verify the integrity of the data hierarchy
* You can query any member and object of the store
* You can use pointers to them in the engine
* You can apply patches to any object at any time


### Database subtrees

Problem: Different Players have different states of the same nyan tree.

Solution: Create another hierarchy of state trees.

A nyan database can have a parent database.

The child database then stores the state for the player, the parent the
global state.

What does that mean?

* One can create a sub-database of the main database
* If a patch is applied in that subdatabase, the main one remains unchanged
  and just queries to the subdatabase will yield an updated result
* Internally, this works as follows:
  * Query the subdatabase for a patch object
    * If it is known in the subdatabase, return it
    * Else return it from the parent database
  * When that patch is applied to a subdatabase, the subdatabase tries to
    * Find the target object in its store or otherwise get it from the
      parent database. If it doesn't have it either, query the next parent
      until the root was reached.
    * If it was not found in in the subdatabase, create an object with the
      target object name in the subdatabase which inherits from the object
      in the parent database. This is repeated until the direct parent
      database has a object of the correct name.
    * Apply the patch to the object in the subdatabase.

If objects are queried in subdatabases and not found, the query is
redirected to their parent database and no child object is created in the
subdatabase.

If they were found, the value is determined via the inheritance tree
normally.

This approach reuses the value generation for same-named objects in
different databases. If the team gets a database with the main db as
parent and each player gets a database with the matching team db as
parent, team boni and player specific updates can be handled in an "easy"
way.



### API

Create a `NyanDatabase` and feed `.nyan` files into it.
Query for `NyanObjects` and apply `NyanObjects` as patch.
Query a `NyanObject` for member values.


## nyanc - the nyan compiler

**nyanc** can compile a .nyan file to a .h and .cpp file, this just creates
a new nyan type the same way the primitive types from above are defined.

Members can then be acessed directly from C++.

The only problem still unsolved with `nyanc` is:

If a "non-optimized" `nyan::Object` has multiple parents where some of them
were "optimized" and made into native code by `nyanc`, we can't select
which of the C++ objects to instanciate for it. And we can't create the
combined "optimized" object as the `nyan::Object` appeared at runtime.

This means we have to provide some kind of annotation, which of the parents
should be the annotated ones.

Nevertheless, `nyanc` is just an optimization, and has therefore no
priority until we need it.


## openage specific "standard library"

nyan in openage has specific requirements how to handle patches:
mods, technologies, technology-technologies.

### Defined `nyan::Object`s

The openage engine defines a few objects to inherit from.
The engine reacts differently when children of those `nyan::Object`s are
created.

#### Data updates

##### `Mod`: Game mods

* It has a member `patches` where you should add your patches.
* When created, the Engine will apply the patches on load time.

##### `Tech`: Technologies

* Has a member `updates` that contains the patches to apply when researched


#### Engine features

A game engine can only process and display things it was programmed for.
That's why those features have explicit hooks when used in nyan.

The nyan definition of objects that provide configuration of such features
is thereby shipped with the engine.

A few examples

##### `Resource`: Resource types

* The engine supports adding and removing new resources via mods
* The GUI, statistics, game logic, ... subsystems dynamically take
  care of the available resources

##### `Ability`: Available unit actions

* Base object for something a unit can do
* `Movement`, `Gather`, `ResourceGenerator`,
  `ResourceSpot`, ... defined and implemented by engine as well
* The engine implements all kinds of things for the abilities
  and also triggers actions when the ability is invoked

##### `DropSite`: Object where resources can be brought to

* The engine movement and pathfinding system must know about dropsites
* Configures the allowed resources

##### `Unit`: In-game objects

* Base object for things you can see in-game
* Provides `ability` member which contains a set of abilities

##### Many many more.

* Your game engine may define completely different objects
* How and when a patch is applied is completely up to the engine
* nyan is just the tool for keeping the data store


### Unit hierarchy

By using the objects defined by the engine, units can be defined in a
nyan file not part of the engine, but rather a data pack for it.

Lets start with an example inheritance hierarchy:

`malte23 (instance) <- Crossbowman <- Archer <- RangedUnit (engine) <- Unit (engine) <- Object (built in)`

Why:

* There's a base nyan object, defined in the language internally
* The engine support units that move on screen
* The engine supports attack projectile ballistics
* All archers may receive armor/attack bonus updates
* Crossbowmen is an archer and can be built at the archery

`malte23` walks on your screen and dies laughing.
It is _not_ a `nyan::Object` but rather an unit object of the game engine
which references to the `Crossbowman` `nyan::Object` to get properties from.
`malte23` is handled in the unit movement system but the speed,
healthpoints and so on are fetched for malte's unit type, which is
`Crossbowman`, managed by nyan.


## Modding examples

### New resource

Let's create a new resource.

``` python

# Defined in the game engine:

Mod():
    name : text
    patches : set(Patch)

Building():
    name : text

Resource():
    name : text
    icon : file

DropSite():
    accepted_resources : set(Resource)


# Above are engine features.
# Lets create content in your official game data pack now:

Gold(Resource):
    name = "Bling bling"
    icon = "gold.svg"

Food(Resource):
    name = "Nom nom"
    icon = "food.svg"

TownCenter(Building, DropSite):
    name = "Town Center"
    accepted_resources = {Gold, Food}


# Now let's have a user mod that adds a new resource:

Silicon(Resource):
    name = "Silicon"

TCSilicon<TownCenter>():
    allowed_resources += {Silicon}

SiliconMod(Mod):
    name = "The modern age has started: Behold the microchips!"
    patches = {TCSilicon}

```

In the mod pack config file, `SiliconMod` is listed to be loaded.
That pack config format may be a simple .conf-style file.

When those nyan files are loaded, the all the objects are added. Your game
engine implements that the `SiliconMod` is displayed in some mod list and
that all `patches` from activated `Mod`s are applied at game start time.

The load order of the user supplied `Mod`s is to be determined by the
game engine. Either via some mod manager, or automatic resolution.
It's up to the engine to implement.


### Patching a patch example

A user mod that patches loom to increase villager hp by 10 instead of 15.

0. Loom is defined in the base data pack
1. The mod defines to update the original loom tech
2. The tech is researched, which applies the updated loom tech to the
   villager instance of the current player

``` python

# Game engine defines:
Tech():
    name : text
    updates : set(Patch)

Mod():
    name : text
    patches : set(Patch)

Ability():
    mouse_animation : file

Unit():
    name : text
    hp : int
    abilities : set(Ability)

Building():
    name : text
    researches : set(Tech)
    creates : set(Unit)


# Base game data defines:
Villager(Unit):
    name = "Villager"
    hp = 25

LoomVillagerHP<Villager>():
    hp += 15

Loom(Tech):
    name = "Research Loom to give villagers more HP"
    updates = {LoomVillagerHP}

TownCenter(Building):
    researches = {Loom}
    creates = {Villager}

### Creating a new ability

Now let's create the ability to teleport for the villager.

Abilities are used as [entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system).
The game engine uses sets of those to modify unit behavior.


* Abilities can define properties like their animation
* An ability can be added as a tech to some units at runtime
  ("villagers and the tentacle monster can now teleport")
* Behavior must be implemented in the engine
  * If custom behavior is required, it must be set up through a scripting API of the engine
  * `nyan` can change and updated called function names etc to
    activate the scripting changes, but how is up to the engine


``` python

# The engine defines:
Mod():
    name : text
    patches : set(Patch)

Ability():
    mouse_animation : file

Unit():
    name : text
    hp : int
    abilities : set(Ability)

Resource():
    name : text
    icon : file

DropSite():
    accepted_resources : set(Resource)

Animation():
    image : file
    frames : int = 1
    loop : bool = True
    speed : float = 15.0

Ability():
    animation : Animation

CooldownAbility(Ability):
    recharge_time : float

Movement(Ability):
    speed : float
    instant : bool = False
    range : float = inf

CollectResource(Movement):
    target : Resource
    collect_animation : Animation


# Base game data defines:
Wood(Resource):
    name = "chop chop"
    icon = "wood.svg"

VillagerWalking(Animation):
    image = "walking_villager.png"
    frames = 18

VillagerMovement(Movement):
    animation = VillagerWalking
    speed = 15.0

WoodTransport(Animation):
    image = "wood_transport.png"
    frames = 20

WoodChop(Animation):
    image = "wood_transport.png"
    frames = 20

CollectWood(CollectResource):
    target = Wood
    animation = WoodTransport
    collect_animation = WoodChop
    speed = 12.0

Villager(Unit):
    name = "Villager"
    hp = 25
    abilities += {VillagerMovement, CollectWood}


# Teleport mod:
TeleportBlurb(Animation):
    image = "teleport_whooosh.png"
    frames = 10
    speed = 2

Teleport(Movement, CooldownAbility):
    speed = 0.0
    instant = True
    recharge_time = 30.0
    range = 5
    animation = TeleportBlurb

EnableTeleport<Villager>():
    abilities += {Teleport}

TeleportMod(Mod):
    name = "Awesome teleport feature to sneak into bastions easily"
    patches = {EnableTeleport}
```

* Why does `Teleport` inherit from both `Movement` and `CooldownAbility`?
  * Teleport is another movement variant, but the cooldown timer must be mixed in.
    After an ability was used, the engine checks if the `Ability` is a `CooldownAbility`,
    and then deactivates the ability for some time for that unit.
    When the engine checks `Teleport.is_child_of(CooldownAbility)`,
    it is true and the timer routine will run.
* Why is there an `instant` member of `Movement`?
  * The game engine must support movement without pathfinding, otherwise even
    movement with infinite speed would be done by pathfinding.

This demonstrated that modding capabilities are strongly limited by the game
engine, nyan just assists you in designing a mod api in an intuitive way.
